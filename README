Small python script to decode the outdoor sensor signal of the Sempre weather station (as sold by ALDI in fall 2015)

Requirements:
-Sempre weather station (as sold by ALDI Germany in fall 2015)
-A rtl-sdr stick
-the rtl_fm command line tool
-python3
-gnu-coreutils
-Linux (this can be easily changed to work on Windows though)

Please run gqrx (or similar software) first and check the frequency your outdoor sensor uses. Then change the frequency in 'getTemperature.sh' accordingly.
(You should start looking around 434MHz)

Usage: 
clone this repository and run 'getTemperature.sh'
This will start listening for the signal. Data is written to /tmp. It will collect data for 60 seconds since the signal is send approximately once every minute.
Next the decoder is called and finally the recorded data is deleted.
